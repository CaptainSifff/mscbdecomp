This is a project to get a working implementation of the minimum split checkerboard decomposition by
Che-Rung Lee in SIAM Vol 35, No 2, pp. C143-C171

# PREREQUISITES #
A fortran 2003 compatible compiler.
# CONFIGURATION #

# TESTING #

# USAGE #

# TODO DOC #

# TODO CODE #

# Notes #
This code utilizes the Misra and Gries edge coloring algorithm.

Here's the original paper on the algorithm:
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/misra/psp.dir/vizing.pdf

It features an implementation of the Misra-van-Gries Edge coloring algorithm.
Stuff that can also be found is a path structure that mimics the basic behaviour of 
the C++ vector (de to a lack of templates only for two integers.)
as well as a quicksort on integers and a binary search on integers.
